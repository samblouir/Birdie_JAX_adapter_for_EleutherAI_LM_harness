==============
Birdie Adapter
==============
Interface to the Birdie server for the EleutherAI LM Harness.

Installation:
	Please place this file in the following location:
		.../lm-evaluation-harnesss/lm_eval/models/birdie_adapter.py
	Please see the readme.md for full installation instructions.

How this is used:
	This file is called by the EleutherAI LM Harness, and acts as an interface to the Birdie server.

At one point, the EleutherAI LM Harness was somehow taking the GPU away from JAX.
You may need to add this to the beginning of "__main__.py" at .../lm-evaluation-harness/lm-eval/__main__.py
  import os
  os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = ""

If the Harness is still taking the GPU, here are two nuclear options:
	- Call the lm_eval harness within a Docker container that does not have access to the GPU.
    - Installing Torch without GPU support in a seperate Python environment or installation.

Important note for NVIDIA users (repeated from readme.md):
	You may need to re-install JAX after installing Torch. Torch may install different CUDA packages, breaking JAX.
